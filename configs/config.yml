    # If you don't want to read whole folder you can just read single files with this.
    # Watching individual files (rather than directories) is generally not recommended as many tools update files atomically.
    # Instead of "just" writing to the file a temporary file will be written to first, and if successful the temporary file
    # is moved to to destination removing the original, or some variant thereof.
    # The watcher on the original file is now lost, as it no longer exists.
    #
    # LIMITATIONS: Do NOT add the main config file (this file) to this.
