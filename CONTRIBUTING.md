TL;DR

- [Project Layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout) - where it makes sense.
- [Code Style](https://github.com/uber-go/guide/blob/master/style.md) - where it makes sense.
- [Commit Messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) - only the summary is good enough.
- [Versioning](https://semver.org/)

### Project Layout
