# Getting Started

There are multiple ways to install or setup you Infrared instance. Depending on what setup you choose you will have different pro and cons in usage and update cycles.

## Quick Start

One of the quickest ways to get started is by just downloading the [latest release of Infrared](https://github.com/haveachin/infrared/releases/) from GitHub for your machine and executing it.

### Find the binary for your system

Most common ones are in **bold**.

| Hardware                    | OS              | for 32-bit    | for 64-bit         |
|-----------------------------|-----------------|---------------|--------------------|
| PC, VPS or Root Server      | Linux based     | Linux_i386*   | **Linux_x86_64**   |
| Raspberry Pi                | Raspberry Pi OS | Linux_armv6*  | **Linux_arm64**    |
| Custom/Prebuild PC          | Windows         | Windows_i386* | **Windows_x86_64** |
| Intel Mac or MacBook        | macOS           | -             | Darwin_x86_64      |
| M1 or higher Mac or MacBook | macOS           | -             | Darwin_arm64       |
